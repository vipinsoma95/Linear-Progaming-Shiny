Linear programming (LP, also called linear optimization) is a method to achieve the  best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.
# Shiny and LP?
Using shiny  we are trying to creat an interactive app which is able to perform linear programing for different user inputs.
